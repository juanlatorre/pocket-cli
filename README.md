# pocket-cli
Pocket CLI for personal use (tired of sending links to phone through Chrome or Pocket gui)

# Before Install

First, you must have 2 env keys in your system.

```
$ export POCKET_CONSUMER_KEY="your-consumer-key"

$ export POCKET_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-access-token"
```

If you don't know your access token get it here with your Consumer Key -> [Get Access Token](http://reader.fxneumann.de/plugins/oneclickpocket/auth.php)

# Install

```
$ python3 setup.py
```
