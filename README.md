# pocketcli
Pocket CLI for personal use (tired of sending links to phone through Chrome or Pocket gui)

# Install

```
$ python3 setup.py
```

# How to Use

First, you must run CONFIG

```
$ pocketcli config
```

This will prompt for two thing, your *CONSUMER_KEY* and your *ACCESS_TOKEN*, after that you can just run

```
$ pocketcli add <'url'>
```

If you don't know your access token get it here with your Consumer Key -> [Get Access Token](http://reader.fxneumann.de/plugins/oneclickpocket/auth.php)
